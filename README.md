## Dev Setup

### pre-commit

Python is required to run `pre-commit`, easiest way to get Python on Windows is to download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, ensure `pip` is working and install `pre-commit`:
```
pip install pre-commit
```

And then in the root project directory run the following command to install the pre-commit hooks:
```
pre-commit install
```
